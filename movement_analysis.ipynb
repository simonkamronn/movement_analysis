    "# Exploratory analysis of location data\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Analysis of spatio-temporal movement data can seem to be a privilegium of the Geographical Information Science(GISc) community and require the use of traditional Geographic Information System(GIS) tools (e.g. ArcGIS). Tools of which most are either expensive or difficult to learn to use efficiently and correctly. They can naturally add great value to the analysis but can also be an obstacle for outsiders and hamper the understanding of underlying algorithms applied to the data. Furthermore, relying on existing tools you may arrive at the wrong conclusion because the tools doesn't fit the question you ask.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in (Van der Spek, 2009) movement tracking through GPS was at that time identified as having great potential for analysing movement patterns in cities but they also foresaw difficulties in analysing the data with their relatively manual approach relying on visualizations. The possible scale of this type of study was seen in (Stopczynski, 2014) with a cohort of 1000 individuals in Copenhagen spanning multiple years. At this scale automation of analysis becomes a necessity fast. Because movement analysis is an important topic in GISc it has received a lot of attention in research and development over the past decade. Some even argues that Computational Movement Analysis(CMA) has reached a level in which all the *soft* problems are solved but many harder problems with more abstract inferences are still not addressed(Laube, 2015). The *hard* problems are of particular interest because it is here we move into the realm of cognition and begin to understand human behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the study my PhD project is part of we explore the ability of smartphones and apps (as personalized lifestyle devices) to motivate, monitor, and maintain physical activity in overweight individuals. Specifically the project address smartphone and wearable sensing as means to monitor physical activity, estimate energy expenditure, establish the domains in daily life (home, transportation, occupational and leisure) in which physical activity occur, as well as assist individuals in maintaining physical activity through biofeedback interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is carried out in collaboration with University of Copenhagen (KU Sund) and leverages an ongoing randomized clinical trial, GO-ACTIWE (Governing Obesity- Active Commuting to Improve Well-being and health in Everyday life), in which the health effects of physical activity in transportation and leisure-time domains of everyday life is evaluated. Participants in the GO-ACTIWE trial are randomized to one of four 6-month interventions consisting of 3 different exercise regimes and one control group. Participants undergo rigorous biomedical testing before and at 1, 3 and 6 months of the intervention and data on physical activity and energy expenditure will be acquired and participants will be monitored across multiple domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the presentations of mainly Patrick Laube and Stefan van der Spek during the PhD course Human mobility, cognition and GISc, I was introduced to a broader scope of opportunities in analysing spatio-temporal data, specifically trajectories and the behavioural aspects. I have here chosen to analyse the data I have available without using a GIS toolbox in order to not confine myself within the traditions of GISc but still retain the possibility of drawing inspiration from the literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spirit of Quantified Self, the concept of quantifying yourself through tracking, I will analyse my movement data collected by my smartphone and stored by Google. That is, data that is available to anyone with a smartphone and any researcher with permission to access the data. I choose this perspective because my project concerns what we can infer from personal devices and from sharing this hopefully someone will find it useful. The approach is very ad hoc and progress in a natural way with each step building on the previous. "

    "The method applied clusters the points in two stages(Cuttone, 2014). At first the points within a distance are assigned to groups sequentially with the first point as the reference. If a point is too far from the first point in the group, a new group is created with that point as the reference. Initially this strategy creates a lot of groups but by discarding groups where the stay period is smaller than a threshold removes most of them. In this case 15 minutes was chosen as stay threshold and 150 meters as spatial cluster limit based on empirical results from (Cuttone, 2014).\n",

    "The duration of a stop varies from 15 minutes to hours so it is probably more correct to look at the time spent at each stop. Interestingly we see that outside the home and work, the time spent at different destinations are logarithmically declining. The amount of time at home or at work explains a larger amount of the total time compared to just the number of stops. This is, however, expected since the algorithm should create one long stop from when we arrive to when we leave. "

    "From the four different plots we can make some educated guesses about what these locations has of significance. From **a)** we can see that cluster 0 must be home since a lot of time is spent at night while cluster 8 must be work since many hours in the middle of the day is used here. The yellow line, cluster 3, is a bit odd but this is because I some times have meetings at KU in the morning after which I go home to work. From **b)** and **c)** we can further see that cluster 17 is a place almost only visited during weekends and is incidently my parents home i Aarhus. The last cluster is difficult to infer anything about from the first three plots but from **d)** we see that it emerges for a short period from which we can infer that it is a vacataion or external stay of a kind. In most cases it is probably save to infer home from the cluster which most time is spent during night and work as the cluster with most time spent at e.g. 10 am. "

    "## Final remarks\n",
    "Computational movement analysis is very powerful when quantifying human behaviour and as location data is practically free to sample from modern smartphones, the potential of research in this field is vast. As both Spek and Laube mentions, the analysis becomes much richer when aggregating data from additional sensors but many of these are also available in smartphones. In my project we also sample the accelerometer and the plan is to combine these with inferences from the movement analysis. The accelerometer provides high resolution information of small local changes in position but is not suited for inference of higher scale dynamics. Combining with location data we can make stronger inferences about what type of activity or situation people are in. As showed we can with relatively high certainty identify the domain (transport, home, work, leisure) people are in and using accelerometer data we hope to calculate a precise estimation of energy expenditure. The raw accelerometer data is a good measure in many cases but by having the speed and elevation when people are biking or walking in a hilly terrain, the estimation becomes much more accurate. Same goes for inference of the type of activity. \n",

    "The analysis up to this point has prepared the movement data for the combined modelling but it is not extensive and as comments along the way suggests there is various ways of improving and extending, including leveraging more advanced methods and other APIs. It has, however, shown how to acquire, pre-process and analyse movement data in different ways for different purposes using both simple visualisations and external services."
